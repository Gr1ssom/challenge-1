# MY FIRST COMPLETED CHALLENGE!

I combined similar classes in CSS to consolidate code and to leave it better than I found it. I also gave the <div> tags semantic names and ordered my CSS style sheet in the logical order of the HTML page. All of my links work as expected in the navbar and images have alt text.

## Thank you!

Thanks for checking out my first challenge at bootcamp!
